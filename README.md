## What is this Ad Necronomicon
AD Necronomicon is a passwort assesment tool for your active directory. 
With an adminstrator account it gets all user hashes from a domain controller.
A part of the hash gets send to the backend and compared to a database.
All potential matches get send back and compared with the full hash.
If there is a match you will get informed about the weak/leaked password of the user.

### The server never knows the whole hash and even the script does not know the real password behind the hash
